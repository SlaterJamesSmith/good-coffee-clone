| This page is meant for design and responsive design practice only, so buttons will not be clickable | User clicks button or content | nothing happens |
| Page content will remain static in size when the viewport width is greater than 1047px, except for the hero image, which will adjust its size to fill the width of the page | User changes window width from 1050px to 1200px | All images stay centered, but picture of succulent plant changes size |
| Between viewport widths of 1047px and 767px, all content will adjust size to fit within screen | User changes window width from 1200px to 1000px | All images adjust to smaller sizes to fit viewport |
| Between viewport widths of 767px and 500px, navigation bar menu will change styling to fit viewport, and text in footer will change to a smaller font size | User changes window width from 1000px to 700px | Top menu options change from 5 to 3 buttons, text at bottom of the screen becomes smaller |
| Below viewport width of 500px, all content will stack in a column | User changes window width from 700px to 400px | Each block of content appears in its own line, filling the majority of the width of the page |
